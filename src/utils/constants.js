  {
    q: 'Why are there 2 Etherscan links?',
    a: 'There are 2 Etherscan links because there are 2 different NFTs you can mint. We have the Monsters - the creatures and beasts who roam the land. Next, we have the Monster Maps, which show you where each of these Monsters spawn on a Map.'
  },
  {
    q: 'Should I mint a Monster or Monster Map ?',
    a: 'You can mint either a Monster or a Monster Map. Minting a Monster Map would show you the Monsters on your map, which you can go mint new Monsters!'
  },
  {
    q: 'Do we need to overlay Maps & Monster Maps ?',
    a: "Not for now, as it is just a demo we do to show how we derived Monster Maps' spawn points from Maps."
  },
  {
    q: "I've just minted a Monster / Monster Map and it shows the 'Monster Maps' logo on Opensea. Why is this happening?",
    a: 'Be patient, young traveler. Give Opensea a while and the full image of your Monster / Monster Map will be generated'
  },
  {
    q: 'How is this related to Loot ?',
    a: "Monster Maps lives in the wider ecosystem of the Loot project. We are in the process of getting added to Loot's Derivative projects. You do not need to own a Loot to mint or buy a Monster or a Monster Map!"
  },
  {
    q: 'How is this related to Maps project ?',
    a: "Monster Map is a derivative of Maps, where we derived Monster Maps' spawn points from the locations in Maps. If you find a Map and Monster Map with a similar ID, you'll see that the locations have Monsters spawned there."
  },
  {
    q: 'Why are there Monsters beyond #9750 if we can only mint from #1 - #9750 ?',
    a: 'As this is a fair mint project, the Monsters from #9751 - #10000 are allocated for the dev fund to kickstart, build and grow this world of Monster Maps, as well as fund public goods within the Web3 ecosystem.'
  },
  {
    q: 'Who is behind this ?',
